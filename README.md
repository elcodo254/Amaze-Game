-----

### Installation
- [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) is required to compile and use this program
- Compile with `gcc 4.8.4` with the following flags:
    ``gcc -g -Isrc/headers *.c -lSDL2 -lm -o maze `sdl2-config --cflags --libs` `` OR `make all`
- Run the maze: `./maze

-----

### Usage
This 3D maze uses raycasting to draw the maze walls, utilizing [LodeV's](http://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html) method of using vectors to calculate ray length. Currently the maze has flat colors and textured walls/floors.Texturing can be turned on and off.

#### Movement
- `W` : move forward
- `S` : move backward
- `A` : rotate camera left
- `D` : rotate camera right
- `Q` : strafe left
- `E` : strafe right
- `ESC` : quit

#### Maps
The maps are defined in 2D arrays in text files, which are parsed when passed as an argument to the maze executable. `0` represents open space, all other integers are drawn as walls.

Example:
```

```

### Improvements
Although the method used to draw the walls has been improved on over the years, using the non-horizontal method was the most comprehensive.Since the project is still a work in progress, using the new method and adding more feautures will be embarked on.
